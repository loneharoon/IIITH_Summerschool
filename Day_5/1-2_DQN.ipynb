    "In this lab we will train a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent to play Pong task (Atari game) from OpenAI gym.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Task\n",
    "The game of Pong is an excellent example of a simple RL task. In the ATARI 2600 version we’ll use you play as one of the paddles (the other is controlled by a decent AI) and you have to bounce the ball past the other player (I don’t really have to explain Pong, right?). On the low level the game works as follows: we receive an image frame (a 210x160x3 byte array (integers from 0 to 255 giving pixel values)) and we get to decide if we want to move the paddle UP or DOWN (i.e. a binary choice). After every single choice the game simulator executes the action and gives us a reward: Either a +1 reward if the ball went past the opponent, a -1 reward if we missed the ball, or 0 otherwise. And of course, our goal is to move the paddle so that we get lots of reward.\n",

    "## 2. From Q-Network to Deep Q-Network\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that ordinary Q-network was able to barely perform as well as the Q-Table in a simple game environment, Deep Q-Networks are much more capable. In order to transform an ordinary Q-Network into a DQN we will be making the following improvements:\n",
    "- Going from a single-layer network to a multi-layer convolutional network.\n",
    "- Implementing Experience Replay, which will allow our network to train itself using stored memories from it’s experience.\n",
    "- Utilizing a second “target” network, which we will use to compute target Q-values during our updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was these three innovations that allowed the [Google DeepMind team to achieve superhuman performance on dozens of Atari games using their DQN agent](http://www.davidqiu.com:8888/research/nature14236.pdf). We will be walking through each individual improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addition 1: Convolutional Layers\n",
    "Since our agent is going to be learning to play video games, it has to be able to make sense of the game’s screen output in a way that is at least similar to how humans or other intelligent animals are able to. Instead of considering each pixel independently, convolutional layers allow us to consider regions of an image, and maintain spatial relationships between the objects on the screen as we send information up to higher levels of the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Addition 2: Experience Replay\n",
    "The second major addition to make DQNs work is Experience Replay. The basic idea is that by storing an agent’s experiences, and then randomly drawing batches of them to train the network, we can more robustly learn to perform well in the task. By keeping the experiences we draw random, we prevent the network from only learning about what it is immediately doing in the environment, and allow it to learn from a more varied array of past experiences. Each of these experiences are stored as a tuple of $\\text{<state, action, reward, next_state>}$. The Experience Replay buffer stores a fixed number of recent memories, and as new ones come in, old ones are removed. When the time comes to train, we simply draw a uniform batch of random memories from the buffer, and train our network with them. For our DQN, we have a helper function named `ReplayBuffer` which implements this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addition 3: Separate Target Network\n",
    "The third major addition to the DQN that makes it unique is the utilization of a second network during the training procedure. This second network is used to generate the target-Q values that will be used to compute the loss for every action during training. Why not use just use one network for both estimations? The issue is that at every step of training, the Q-network’s values shift, and if we are using a constantly shifting set of values to adjust our network values, then the value estimations can easily spiral out of control. The network can become destabilized by falling into feedback loops between the target and estimated Q-values. In order to mitigate that risk, the target network’s weights are fixed, and only periodically or slowly updated to the primary Q-networks values. In this way training can proceed in a more stable manner."
