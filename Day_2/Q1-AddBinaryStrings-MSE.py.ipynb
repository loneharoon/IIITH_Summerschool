    "In this first lab, to get familiar with RNNs, we will explore the simple problem of teaching an RNN to add binary strings. Recall, like grade-school addition, binary addition moves from the right-most bit (least-significant bit or LSB) towards the left-most bit (most-significant) bit, with a carry bit passed from the previous addition.\n",

    "If the bit strings 010 (integer value = 2) and 011 (integer value = 3) are to be added to produce the sum 101 (integer value 5), the following is the sequence of inputs and targets to the RNN when training:\n",

    "You might notice that the steps --- `softmax` followed by `cross-entropy` loss, first exponentiate and then take the log of the score. This is numerically unstable due to under/overflow (in the exponentiation). As this is a widely used operation, `PyTorch` combines these two steps in their [`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#crossentropyloss) function. So if we use this function, we do not have to explicitly use `softmax`.\n",
